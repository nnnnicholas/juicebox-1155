{"name": "Juicebox Cards","description": "Juicebox Cards are a fun way to keep track of the health of your favorite Juicebox projects, right inside your own wallet! Juicebox Cards are NFT editions. Each Card corresponds to a Juicebox Project. Project Cards display the same metadata as the canonical Juicebox Project NFT. Juicebox Cards display live treasury statistics for the corresponding project. If project owners customize their project metadata, their project's Juicebox Cards will automatically update accordingly.","image": "ipfs://QmVeFawghfNCMvm756SAf6JD7gMiKx1cWq8ZvY552GoGeF","external_link": "https://juicebox.cards"}
